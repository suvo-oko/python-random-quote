Responsive is better than fast
It is not fully shipped until it is fast
Anything added dilutes everything else
Practicality beats purity
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak like a human
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
Keep work visible
Breathe light to breathe right
Conversation is our superpower
Be radically transparent
